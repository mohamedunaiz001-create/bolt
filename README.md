## Overview

BOLT combines an AI mentor, UPSC-focused practice systems, a persistent student-progress layer, and a grounded Knowledge/RAG system.

**Learning loop:**

`Study → Practice → Evaluate → Diagnose → Revise → Practice Again`

Progress signals are intentionally separated: syllabus coverage, diagnostic knowledge, Prelims accuracy, Mains performance, and revision state are not collapsed into one opaque score.

### Production storage model

- **Firestore:** authoritative application and user data
- **Cloud Storage:** persistent documents, backups, and artifacts
- **Local filesystem:** cache/staging only where explicitly supported
- **Cloud Run/serverless API:** backend execution
- **External scheduler:** recurring current-affairs jobs in cloud production

## Security

BOLT is designed around authenticated, user-scoped access.

- Firebase authentication and backend token verification
- `requireAuth` and `requireAdmin` authorization
- Default-deny Firestore rules
- Per-user ownership checks
- Protected admin/training operations
- API rate limiting
- Server-side AI credentials
- No service-account credentials in the client
- AI provider secrets kept out of browser builds
- Controlled document access
- Account/data deletion workflows

**Never commit `.env`, service-account keys, private keys, or other production secrets.**

## Tech stack

**Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Motion, Recharts, React Markdown, jsPDF, Lucide React

**Backend:** Node.js, Express, TypeScript, Firebase Admin SDK, Firestore, Firebase Storage, Google GenAI SDK, Express Rate Limit

**AI / Knowledge:** AI Gateway, RAG, semantic/keyword retrieval, grounding, citation validation, UPSC-specific evaluation

**Desktop:** Electron/electron-builder when building the Windows distribution

## Requirements

- Node.js **24.x**
- npm
- Firebase project with Authentication and Firestore
- Server-side AI credentials for the selected provider

Optional:
- Python 3.x for Python-assisted tooling
- Electron build tooling for Windows packaging

## Quick start

### 1. Clone

```bash
git clone https://github.com/mohamedunaiz001-create/bolt.git
cd bolt
```

### 2. Install

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Configure environment

Copy `.env.example` to `.env` and provide the variables required by your environment.

```bash
# macOS/Linux
cp .env.example .env

# Windows PowerShell
Copy-Item .env.example .env
```

Keep secrets server-side and never commit `.env`.

### 4. Run locally

```bash
npm run dev
```

### 5. Production build

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm start
```

## Verification

Run the available production verification suites before releasing:

```bash
npm run lint
npm run build
npm run test:security
npm run test:acceptance
npm run benchmark
```

These cover TypeScript validation, production compilation, authentication/data isolation, end-to-end journeys, and AI/RAG/UPSC benchmark behavior.

## Deployment

### Vercel

The repository includes `vercel.json` with the production build configuration.

```bash
npm install
npm run build
vercel deploy
vercel deploy --prod
```

Set production environment variables in the Vercel project settings. Do not expose server-only secrets through `VITE_*` variables.

**Important:** a long-running Express server, durable worker, or in-process scheduler should not be assumed to behave like a permanently running serverless process. Use the intended production backend/runtime and an external scheduler for recurring jobs.

### Cloud Run

The production architecture can run the backend as a containerized service with managed HTTPS. For cloud deployments, recurring current-affairs execution should use the protected scheduler endpoint rather than an in-process timer.

## Current Affairs Scheduler

Production cloud deployments use an external scheduler to call the protected current-affairs synchronization endpoint. The endpoint must be protected by its scheduler secret and must never be exposed as an unauthenticated public mutation endpoint.

## Windows desktop

BOLT can be packaged as a Windows desktop application using Electron/electron-builder. The desktop client should communicate with the production BOLT API over HTTPS rather than embedding server-side credentials in the installer.

A release build should produce a signed/verified Windows installer and must keep backend secrets outside the client bundle.

## Environment variables

See [`.env.example`](./.env.example) for the current configuration surface. Variables cover AI providers, Firebase, scheduler/security settings, local AI endpoints, and development/test controls.

Only configure the providers/features you actually use.

## Operations

Before a production release:

1. Run all verification suites.
2. Verify Firebase Authentication and Firestore rules.
3. Verify two-user isolation.
4. Confirm Firestore and Cloud Storage are authoritative in production.
5. Test current-affairs scheduler execution.
6. Verify backup/restore procedures.
7. Check `/api/health` and telemetry.
8. Keep a known-good deployment available for rollback.

See [`ROLLBACK.md`](./ROLLBACK.md) for the repository rollback procedure.

## Release

**BOLT v1.0.0**

The repository contains the production-oriented web application, backend services, security rules, RAG/knowledge tooling, current-affairs pipeline, test suites, and deployment configuration.

Treat the actual CI results and deployed environment configuration as the source of truth for each release.

## Contributing

When changing production paths:

- Preserve authentication and authorization boundaries.
- Preserve user data isolation.
- Never add hardcoded credentials or fake production metrics.
- Add tests for behavior changes.
- Run the verification suite before merging.

## License

See the repository license file for the applicable terms.
