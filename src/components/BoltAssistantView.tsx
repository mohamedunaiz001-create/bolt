    return `### Active Reflection & Immediate Insight
Hello ${userName}. I hear you—Herbert Simon's work in *Administrative Behavior* is often perceived as intimidating because it breaks down the neat, prescriptive classical rules and reveals how human, uncertain, and cognitively bounded administrative decision-making actually is. 

At its core, Simon's fundamental breakthrough is that administrative actors cannot be omniscient "Economic Men" who compute all possible permutations; instead, facing cognitive, computational, and temporal limits, they are **"Administrative Men" who satisfice**—selecting alternatives that meet acceptable aspiration thresholds.

---

### Transparent Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### Step 1: Critiquing the Classical "Proverbs"
Simon famously demonstrated that classical principles (Fayol's unity of command, Gulick's POSDCORB) contradict each other in practice (e.g., specialization contradicts hierarchy). He declared that administration is fundamentally a study of **decision-making**, not merely execution.

#### Step 2: Fact Premises vs. Value Premises
Every administrative choice combines two building blocks:
- **Fact Premises:** Empirical, observable descriptions of reality that can be validated as true or false.
- **Value Premises:** Ethical choices, policy goals, or moral imperatives that reflect preferences rather than empirical proof.
Rationality operates strictly on selecting optimal means for given value ends.

#### Step 3: Why Rationality Is Inherently Bounded
Administrators face three non-negotiable real-world constraints:
1. **Cognitive Limits:** Inability to mentally store, calculate, and weigh all conceivable outcomes.
2. **Information & Time Deficits:** Decisions in governance must be executed before complete information can ever be gathered.
3. **Satisficing Behavior:** Administrators search sequentially and stop at the first alternative that satisfies the threshold criteria.

#### Step 4: Concrete Indian Administrative Application (Paper 2 & 2nd ARC)
- **District Administration:** An SDM handling emergency monsoon relief operates under acute bounded rationality, utilizing standard operating procedures (SOPs) and heuristic discretion.
- **2nd ARC 10th Report (Personnel Administration):** Stresses decision-support systems, digitised land records, and MIS dashboards specifically to mitigate bounded rationality in public service delivery.

#### Step 5: UPSC CSE Scoring Edge (Examiner's Lens)
- **Thinker Linkage:** Contrast Simon with Chester Barnard's *Zone of Indifference* and Chris Argyris's *Integration of Individual and Organization*.
- **Diagram Suggestion:** Draw a flowchart contrasting "Economic Man (Global Optimization)" with "Administrative Man (Bounded Search & Satisficing Threshold)".

  if (q.includes("weber") || q.includes("bureaucracy") || q.includes("authority")) {
    return `### Active Reflection & Immediate Insight
Hello ${userName}. Bureaucracy is one of the most debated pillars of our optional, and candidates frequently struggle with separating Max Weber's sociological construct of the "ideal type" from the pejorative modern meaning of red-tape. 

Weber did not design bureaucracy as an empirical description of any single existing country; he conceptualized an **ideal-type model** anchored in **Legal-Rational Authority**, designed to ensure maximum calculability, precision, and impersonality in large-scale social administration.

---

### Transparent Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### Step 1: The Tripartite Classification of Authority
Weber identified three pure types of legitimate authority:
1. **Traditional Authority:** Rooted in inherited sanctified customs and lineage (e.g., feudal monarchies).
2. **Charismatic Authority:** Rooted in extraordinary personal devotion to an exemplary leader (inherently volatile).
3. **Legal-Rational Authority:** Rooted in legally enacted impersonal rules and graded constitutional offices (the bedrock of modern states).

#### Step 2: Structural Characteristics of Ideal-Type Bureaucracy
- **Hierarchy of Offices:** Graded chain of authority with clearly defined appeal pathways.
- **Sphere of Competence:** Codified division of labor bounded by explicit statutory jurisdictions.
- **Impersonality & Sine Ira et Studio:** Decisions rendered without hatred or passion, treating citizens strictly according to the rule of law.
- **Separation of Office and Incumbent:** Officials cannot privatize or own their official positions.

#### Step 3: Dysfunctions & Post-Weberian Thought
- **Robert K. Merton:** Bureaucratic personality leads to "trained incapacity" and goal displacement (rules become ends rather than means).
- **Michel Crozier:** The "Bureaucratic Phenomenon"—rules create protected zones of uncertainty, fostering defensive coalitions.
- **Alvin Gouldner:** Distinction between Mock, Representative, and Punishment-Centered bureaucracies.

#### Step 4: Indian Administrative Realities (Paper 2 & 2nd ARC)
- **Steel Frame vs. Rigidity:** India's All-India Services (protected under Article 311) embody Weberian permanence, yet struggle with accountability deficits and status-quo bias.
- **2nd ARC 4th Report (Ethics in Governance) & 10th Report:** Recommends transitioning from rule-bound compliance to performance management, citizen charters, and lateral entry.

#### Step 5: UPSC CSE Scoring Architecture
- **Critical Distinction:** Always highlight that Weber praised bureaucracy's technical efficiency while simultaneously warning of the **"Iron Cage" (*Stahlhartes Gehäuse*)** of disenchantment.

    return `### Active Reflection & Strategic Insight
Hello ${userName}. It is completely natural during UPSC preparation to look at the vastness of the syllabus and feel a sense of cognitive overload. Let us take a breath, look at your actual telemetry with clarity, and transform that anxiety into a structured sequence of high-return actions.

---

### Step-by-Step Diagnostic & Action Sequence

#### Step 1: Telemetry Assessment
- **Subject:** ${optional} (Target: UPSC CSE)
- **High-Leverage Pivot:** Focus on master concepts in Paper 1 (Administrative Thought & Behaviour) because they provide theoretical fodder that automatically enriches your Paper 2 answers.

#### Step 2: Targeted Remediation for Priority Topics
1. **Administrative Thought (Simon, Weber, Riggs, Follett):**
   - Dedicate a single 60-minute deep-focus block to conceptual deconstruction.
   - Use active recall rather than passive re-reading.
2. **Accountability & Control (Paper 1 & Paper 2):**
   - Consolidate statutory tools: Lokpal, CVC, CAG, RTI Act, and Citizens' Charters.
   - Ground in 2nd ARC Report 4 recommendations.

#### Step 3: Daily Execution Rhythm
- **Morning (45 mins):** 15 targeted Prelims MCQs with detailed analysis of answer rationales.
- **Mid-day (75 mins):** Deep theoretical study of one weak thinker unit.
- **Evening (30 mins):** 1 timed Mains answer (150 words / 10 marks).

  }

  return `### Active Reflection & Conceptual Overview
Hello ${userName}. I hear you—approaching **"${query.trim()}"** thoughtfully requires us to look beyond superficial definitions and understand how this theme interlocks with both administrative theory and real-world Indian governance.

Let us think through this systematically together:

---

### Transparent Step-by-Step Reasoning

#### Step 1: The Core Theoretical Foundation
Within the academic landscape of ${optional}, this topic addresses the continuous dialectic between structural efficiency and human, behavioral responsiveness. 

#### Step 2: Constitutional & Institutional Anchors
In the Indian administrative context, look for the underlying constitutional architecture:
- Relevant Articles of the Constitution (e.g., Articles 311 for civil services, 243 for democratic decentralization, or 280 for fiscal federalism).
- Statutory commissions, appellate mechanisms, or regulatory guardrails.

#### Step 3: Administrative Reality & 2nd ARC Guidance
Abstract principles must be validated against field realities:
- Cross-reference with the 2nd Administrative Reforms Commission (e.g., Report 1 on RTI, Report 4 on Ethics, or Report 12 on Citizen-Centric Governance).
- Identify field implementation bottlenecks (e.g., bureaucratic inertia, resource deficits, or discretionary abuse).

#### Step 4: UPSC CSE Mains Scoring Dimension
- **Paper 1 ↔ Paper 2 Bridge:** High marks come from using Paper 1 thinkers to explain Paper 2 institutional behaviors.
- **Diagrammatic Anchor:** Visualizing this interaction with an input-throughput-output governance loop or stakeholder matrix signals analytical clarity to the examiner.
