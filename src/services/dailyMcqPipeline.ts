    questionText: "With reference to the Inter-State River Water Disputes Act, 1956 and Article 262 of the Constitution, consider the following statements:\n1. Parliament may by law provide that neither the Supreme Court nor any other court shall exercise jurisdiction in respect of any inter-state water dispute.\n2. The decision of a water dispute tribunal once published in the Official Gazette has the same force as an order or decree of the Supreme Court.\n3. The Inter-State River Water Disputes (Amendment) Bill provides for a permanent single tribunal with multiple benches.\nWhich of the statements given above are correct?",

      { key: "D", text: "1, 2 and 3" },

    correctOption: "D",
    explanation: "All three statements are correct. Article 262(2) explicitly empowers Parliament to exclude Supreme Court and all other courts' jurisdiction over inter-state water disputes. Section 6(2) gives tribunal awards the force of an SC decree, and the amendment bill introduces a single permanent tribunal with benches.",
